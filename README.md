# FixEmailAdresses
FixEmailAdresses is a very specific script built to take a database
of email adresses from an Excel file and cleanse them, creating a new Excel
only composed of clean email adresses.  

For example, giving the input "john Doe <john.doe@gmail.com>"
(which is not a correct email adresse) the script will output :
"john.doe@gmail.com" in a new document.
